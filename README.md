This 3D Map Editor is no where near built yet, it's just been a passion project I've been working on over the semester.

I started with Javid's tutorial and continued in my own direction after a bit of experimentation.

The only dependency for this program is SFML.

I hope to be able to update the repository and the README as I get more and more done with the program.
